/* Interface */
// interfaces are binding contracts between two components
// they define the structure of an object
// they are used to define the shape of an object
// they are used to define the shape of a function
// they are used to define the shape of a class

//interfaces are similar to type aliases but they can be extended and implemented
// interfaces can only be used to define the shape of an object or a function
// type aliases can be used to define the shape of any type
